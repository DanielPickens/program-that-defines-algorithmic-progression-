Finds if all distinct values can be returned from an array in an algorithmic progression,  and returns difference 


Given an array of positive integers, check if all its distinct values can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression and return its difference. Otherwise return 0.

Input: [180, 30, 180, 80, 130, 130]
Output: 50
Explanation: [30, 80, 130, 180] is an arithmetic progression with difference = 50 
80 = 30 + 50
130 = 80 + 50
180 = 130 + 50
